## What is Scurry?

Scurry is a self-hosted web application that bridges MyAnonamouse (MAM) and qBittorrent, providing a clean interface to search for and automatically download torrents. Built with Next.js, it offers a modern web UI that makes browsing and downloading content from MAM seamless.

### Key Features

- **Search MAM**: Clean, responsive interface to search MyAnonamouse's extensive library
- **One-click Downloads**: Instantly send torrents to your qBittorrent instance with a single click
- **Direct Integration**: Automatically authenticates with both MAM and qBittorrent APIs
- **URL Query Support**: Pre-fill searches using URL parameters (e.g., `?q=search+term`)
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter results by category, seeders, file types, and more
- **Download Management**: Automatic categorization and organization in qBittorrent
- **Authentication**: Simple password protection for your instance
- **Docker Ready**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose
- **ðŸ¤– MCP Server**: Interface with Claude or ChatGPT to search and download books conversationally (see [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md))

### How It Works

1. **Search**: Enter your search terms in the web interface or use URL parameters (`q=term`)
2. **Browse**: View search results with detailed information (seeders, size, author, etc.)
3. **Download**: Click the download button to automatically add torrents to qBittorrent
4. **Organize**: Torrents are automatically categorized and managed in your qBittorrent instance

### URL Query String Support

You can pre-fill search terms by adding a `q` parameter to the URL:
- `http://localhost:3000/?q=author+name` - Search for a specific author
- `http://localhost:3000/?q=book+title` - Search for a specific book
- `http://localhost:3000/?q=series+name` - Search for a book series

This makes it easy to bookmark searches or integrate with other tools and browser extensions.

## MCP Server (AI Integration)

Scurry includes a **fully MCP-compliant** server that allows you to search for and download books through natural conversation with Claude or ChatGPT!

**Capabilities:**
- ðŸ”§ **Tools**: Search books, download torrents
- ðŸ“š **Resources**: Fetch configuration, browse categories
- ðŸ¤– **Full Protocol Support**: Compatible with any MCP client

**Example conversation:**
```
You: Find audiobooks about ancient Rome
Claude: [Searches and shows results]
You: Download the one by Mary Beard
Claude: [Downloads it to qBittorrent]
```

See the complete setup guide in **[MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md)** for detailed instructions on connecting Scurry to Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible AI assistants.
